# Add Odd Or Subract Even

You are given two positive integers 𝑎 and 𝑏.

In one move, you can change 𝑎 in the following way:

Choose any positive odd integer 𝑥 (𝑥>0) and replace 𝑎 with 𝑎+𝑥;
choose any positive even integer 𝑦 (𝑦>0) and replace 𝑎 with 𝑎−𝑦.
You can perform as many such operations as you want. You can choose the same numbers 𝑥 and 𝑦 in different moves.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain 𝑏 from 𝑎. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain 𝑏 from 𝑎.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases.

Then 𝑡 test cases follow. Each test case is given as two space-separated integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 (1≤𝑎,𝑏≤109).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain 𝑏 from 𝑎 if you can perform any number of moves described in the problem statement. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain 𝑏 from 𝑎.
